# 1 Introduction
###### L2TFSPECINTRO

The L2 WG is an open-source initiative with a scope to
- Identify and document the most relevant use cases and business requirements for Layer 2 and other Blockchain Scalability solutions for EVM compatible public blockchains
- Define a technical standard with identification and differentiation of classes of scalability solutions as required that meet both ecosystem and enterprise requirements, with a particular focus on interoperability between Layer 2 solutions for EVM compatible public blockchains
- For EVM compatible public blockchains, identify, document, and devise solution approaches for Layer 2 Blockchain scalability solution specific challenges such as MEV, block (gas) limits, TVL concentration, etc.
- Identify and document characteristics of Layer 2 Blockchain environments for EVM compatible public blockchains that will be key in addressing mainstream and enterprise adoption.

The work is an Ethereum Community Project which is managed by [OASIS](https://oasis-open-projects.org/).

## 1.1 Overview
###### L2TFSPECOVERV

Layer 2 (L2) Transaction Fees are a crucial element of financing the operations of L2 platforms apart from rewards given to participants for providing economic security guarantees such as validators in consensus protocols. Yet how these transaction fees are derived, to whom they are paid, how and where they are displayed to any of the participants in L2 platforms varies greatly between L2 platforms. 

Given the above, the need for transparency in a open ecosystem to build trust, and the evolving legal and regulatory landscape around fee transparency and what type of fees can be charged, this document sets out to define an Application Programmable Interface (API) based on existing [L2 Transaction Fees Specification](https://github.com/eea-oasis/L2/tree/main/workitems/l2-transaction-fees/l2-transaction-fees-v1.0-psd01.md) to allow ecosystem participants .

Note, that APIs for fees associated with asset and data bridges between L2 platforms as well as between L2 platforms and centralized exchanges are beyond the scope of this document. Further note, while this API is in scope for an entity submitting EIP-2771-type transactions, or EIP-4337-type transactions to a Layer 2, often called a Relayer, the API is out of scope for the entity submitting EIP-2771-type or EIP-4337-type transaction requests to a Relayer.Furthermore, L2 client-specific fees are also out of scope


## 1.2 Glossary
###### L2TFSPECGLOS

**Account:**

A unit that is minimally comprised of a unique account identifier, a deterministic ordering parameter, also referred to as a nonce, a balance of a Layer 1, Layer 2 or Sidechain unit of exchange, also referred to as a protocol token. Changes to an account are controlled by a unique cryptographic public and private key pair. There are typically additional account elements referring to instructions and data associated to the account that determine account changes. 

**Blob Gas:**

A separate L1 gas fee and fee market, separate from the L1 gas fee for non-blob transactions introduced with EIP-1559  It is specifically designed for transactions that include blobs of data. These blobs are chunks of data introduced with the Ethereum Dencun upgrade under EIP-4844 to improve scalability, particularly for Layer 2 solutions.

**Blockchain:**

An open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way.

**Developer:**

An individual writing computer code for software applications that operate on a Layer 1, Layer 2 or Sidechain.

**Data Fee:**

A fee to be paid by the Transaction Originator or Transaction Sender sufficient to cover the Layer 1 transaction fees, and any other transaction data fees related to non-Layer 1 data storage, and excluding a Priority Fee and an Execution Fee.

**Execution Fee:**

A fee to be paid by the Transaction Originator or Transaction Sender sufficient to cover the Layer 2 transaction fees excluding a Priority Fee and a Data Fee.

**Fee Price:**

A Layer 2 gas price or a price of a Layer 2 gas equivalent unit of compute and storage consumption.

Note that a gas price or a price of a Layer 2 gas equivalent unit of compute and storage consumption is typically variable and changes with the level of usage of a Layer 2 network. Note, that a gas price is expressed in Giga Wei (GWEI) for EVM-compatible networks, where Wei represents the smallest unit of gas; 1 Wei = 10<sup>-18</sup> Eth in Ethereum's native token.

**Gas:**

Refers to the unit that measures the amount of computational and storage effort required to execute specific operations on an EVM-compatible network.


**Layer 1:**

A base network, such as Bitcoin, or Ethereum, and its underlying infrastructure that validates and finalizes transactions without the need of another network.

**Layer 2:**

A secondary framework or protocol that is built on top of an existing Layer 1 system in such a way that it inherits the security properties of the Layer 1 system while allowing for a higher transaction throughput than the Layer 1 system.

**Priority Fee:**

Paid by the Transaction Originator or Transaction Sender to obtain a desired slot for its transaction in a new block.

Note that the exact position of a transaction in a new block may be determined by factors such as time-stamp, or minimization of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) of a block in addition to a Priority Fee.

**Relayer:**

An entity receiving EIP-2771-type and EIP-4337-type transaction requests, bundling them into one or more L2 transactions, and submitting those transaction to an L2 on behalf of the requesters.

Note, that Relayers are typically organized into their own Relayer network.

**Transaction:**

A digitally signed message sent from a Layer 2 account that contains instructions and data that result in a Layer 2 state transition. 

**Transaction Fee:**

The fee in a Layer 2 network or protocol token to be paid by a transaction Originator or Transaction Sender comprised of the sum of an Execution Fee, a Data Fee and a Priority Fee.

**Transaction Status:**

The current stage of a Layer 2 transaction in its lifecycle from initial submission on the L2 to finalization on the L1.

Note that the lifecycle stages can vary between different L2 types.


## 1.3 Typographical Conventions
###### L2TFSPECTYPO

### 1.3.1 Requirement Ids
###### L2TFSPECREQIDS

A requirement is uniquely identified by a unique ID composed of its requirement level followed by a requirement number, as per convention **[RequirementLevelRequirementNumber]**. 
There are four requirement levels that are coded in requirement ids as per below convention: 

**[R]** - The requirement level for requirements which IDs start with the letter _R_ is to be interpreted as **MUST** as described in [RFC2119](#rfc2119). \
**[D]** - The requirement level for requirements which IDs start with the letter _D_ is to be interpreted as **SHOULD** as described in [RFC2119](#rfc2119). \
**[O]** - The requirement level for requirements which IDs start with the letter _O_ is to be interpreted as **MAY** as described in [RFC2119](#rfc2119). 

Note that requirements are uniquely numbered in ascending order within each requirement level.

Example : It should be read that [R1] is an absolute requirement of the specification whereas [D1] is a recommendation and [O1] is truly optional.

# 2 Concepts and Design
###### L2TFSPECCONCEPT

The L2 Transaction Fee API specification is written in OpenAPI 3.0.0 format. It describes two endpoints related to Layer 2 (L2) transaction fees in a L2 network.

1. **POST /l2transactionfeeestimate**: This endpoint is used to provide an estimated L2 transaction fee based on a proposed L2 transaction. The request body requires a JSON object with properties such as `transactionCall`, `transactionPriority`, `currency`, and `chainId`. The `transactionCall` object includes details about the transaction such as the sender's address (`from`), the recipient's address (`to`), the gas provided for the transaction execution (`gas`), the gas price (`gasPrice`), the value sent with the transaction (`value`), and the input data (`input`). The response includes the estimated transaction fee broken down into `executionFee`, `dataFee`, `priorityFee`, and the total fee (`totalL2TranactionFee`).

2. **GET /l2transactionfee**: This endpoint retrieves the L2 transaction fee of a submitted transaction based on a transaction hash. The request body requires a JSON object with properties such as `transactionHash`, `currency`, and `chainId`. The response includes the transaction status (`transactionStatus`), the total transaction fee (`totalL2TranactionFee`), and the breakdown of the fee into `executionFee`, `dataFee`, and `priorityFee`.

Both endpoints return a typical HTTP `200` status code for successful requests, with the response body containing detailed information about the transaction fees. And typical HTTP error codes.

The fees are broken down into `executionFee` (the cost of executing the transaction), `dataFee` (the cost of the data to be anchored on an L1 and, possibly, Data Availability solution), and `priorityFee` (the cost based on the priority of the transaction). Each fee is further broken down into the value in the requested currency (`value_currency`), the value in gas units (`value_gas`), and the gas price (`l2GasPrice` for execution fee, `l1GasPrice` for data fee, and `l2PriorityGasPrice` for priority fee). The method, description, and source of the gas price derivation are also included.

# 3 Layer 2 Transaction Fee API Specification

# 4 Conformance

###### L2TFSPECCONF

This section describes the conformance clauses and tests required to achieve an implementation that is provably conformant with the requirements in this document.

## 4.1 Conformance Targets

###### L2TFSPECCONFT

This document does not yet define a standardized set of test-fixtures with test inputs for all MUST, SHOULD, and MAY requirements with conditional MUST or SHOULD requirements. 

A standardized set of test-fixtures with test inputs for all MUST, SHOULD, and MAY requirements with conditional MUST or SHOULD requirements is intended to be published with the next version of the standard.

## 4.2 Conformance Levels
###### L2TFSPECCONFL

This section specifies the conformance levels of this standard. The conformance levels offer implementers several levels of conformance. These can be used to establish competitive differentiation.

This document defines the conformance levels of L2 Transaction Fee API as follows:
* **Level 1:** All MUST requirements are fulfilled by a specific implementation as proven by a test report that proves in an easily understandable manner the implementation's conformance with each requirement based on implementation-specific test-fixtures with implementation-specific test-fixture inputs.
* **Level 2:** All MUST and SHOULD requirements are fulfilled by a specific implementation as proven by a test report that proves in an easily understandable manner the implementation's conformance with each requirement based on implementation-specific test-fixtures with implementation-specific test-fixture inputs.
* **Level 3:** All MUST, SHOULD, and MAY requirements with conditional MUST or SHOULD requirements are fulfilled by a specific implementation as proven by a test report that proves in an easily understandable manner the implementation's conformance with each requirement based on implementation-specific test-fixtures with implementation-specific test-fixture inputs.

#### **[D1]** 
A claim that an L2 Transaction Fee API conforms to this specification SHOULD describe a testing procedure carried out for each requirement to which conformance is claimed, that justifies the claim with respect to that requirement.

[[D1]](#d1) Testability: Since each of the conformance target requirements in this documents is testable, so must be the totality of the requirements in this document. Therefore, conformance tests for all requirements can exist, and can be described as required in [[D1]](#d1).

#### **[R6]** 
A claim that an L2 Transaction Fee API conforms to this specification at **Level 2** or higher MUST describe the testing procedure carried out for each requirement at **Level 2** or higher, that justifies the claim to that requirement.

[[R6]](#r6) Testability: Since each of the non-conformance-target requirements in this documents is testable, so must be the totality of the requirements in this document. Therefore, conformance tests for all requirements can exist, be described, be built and implemented and results can be recorded as required in [[R6]](#r6).

# Appendix B - Security Considerations
###### L2TFSPECAPBSEC

There are no additional security requirements. However, each implementer is encouraged to utilize current API endpoint security best practices such as OAUTH2 endpoint protection, software firewalls, and (Distributed) Denial of Service (DDOS) attack mitigation.  

It should be noted that any Layer 2 should have completed a security audit by a reputable security auditor and resolved all security issues before going to production.

## B.1 Data Privacy
###### L2TFSPECAPBDP

The standard does not set any requirements for compliance to jurisdiction legislation/regulations. It is the responsibility of the implementer to comply with applicable data privacy laws.

## B.2 Production Readiness 
###### L2TFSPECAPBPR

The standard does not set any requirements for the use of specific applications/tools/libraries etc. The implementer should perform due diligence when selecting specific applications/tools/libraries.

## B.3 Internationalization and Localization Reference
###### L2TFSPECAPBINT

The standard encourages implementers to follow the [W3C "Strings on the Web: Language and Direction Metadata" best practices guide](#w3c-string-meta) for identifying language and base direction for strings used on the Web wherever appropriate. 

<!--

(Note: OASIS strongly recommends that Open Projects consider issues that might affect safety, security, privacy, and/or data protection in implementations of their specification and document them for implementers and adopters. For some purposes, you may find it required, e.g. if you apply for IANA registration.

While it may not be immediately obvious how your specification might make systems vulnerable to attack, most specifications, because they involve communications between systems, message formats, or system settings, open potential channels for exploitation. For example, IETF [[RFC3552](#rfc3552)] lists âeavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, and man-in-the-middleâ as well as potential denial of service attacks as threats that must be considered and, if appropriate, addressed in IETF RFCs.

In addition to considering and describing foreseeable risks, this section should include guidance on how implementers and adopters can protect against these risks.

We encourage editors and OP members concerned with this subject to read _Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security Considerations_, IETF [[RFC3552](#rfc3552)], for more information.
