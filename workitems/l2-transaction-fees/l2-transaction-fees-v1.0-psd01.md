# 1 Introduction

The L2 WG is an open-source initiative with a scope to
- Identify and document the most relevant use cases and business requirements for Layer 2 and other Blockchain Scalability solutions for EVM compatible public blockchains
- Define a technical standard with identification and differentiation of classes of scalability solutions as required that meet both ecosystem and enterprise requirements, with a particular focus on interoperability between Layer 2 solutions for EVM compatible public blockchains
- For EVM compatible public blockchains, identify, document, and devise solution approaches for Layer 2 Blockchain scalability solution specific challenges such as MEV, block (gas) limits, TVL concentration, etc.
- Identify and document characteristics of Layer 2 Blockchain environments for EVM compatible public blockchains that will be key in addressing mainstream and enterprise adoption.

The work is an [EEA Community Project](https://entethalliance.org/eeacommunityprojects/), which is managed by [OASIS](https://oasis-open-projects.org/).

## 1.1 Overview

TBD


## 1.2 Glossary

**Blockchain:**

An open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way.

**Gas**

Refers to the unit that measures the amount of computational and storage effort required to execute specific operations on an EVM-compatible network.

**Base Fee**

The Layer 2 gas price. 

Note that a gas price is typically variable and changes with the level of usage of a Layer 2 network and is expressed in Giga Wei (GWEI) for EVM-compatible networks, where Wei represents the smallest unit of gas; 1 Wei = 10<sup>-18</sup> Eth in Ethereum's native token. Also note, that typically there is a minimal, fixed base fee which normally varies by Layer 2 network. 

**Execution Fee**

A fee to be paid by the transaction originator sufficient to cover both the Layer 2 and Layer 1 transaction fees.

An example calculation of such an Execution Fee is:
$$L2\space Gas\space Limit + {L1\space Transaction\space Fee \over L2\space Gas\space Price}$$

**Layer 1:**

A base network, such as Bitcoin, or Ethereum, and its underlying infrastructure that validates and finalizes transactions without the need of another network.

**Layer 2:**

A secondary framework or protocol that is built on top of an existing Layer 1 system in such a way that it inherits the security properties of the Layer 1 system while allowing for a higher transaction throughput that the Layer 1 system.

**Maximal Extractable Value**

Refers to the maximum value that can be extracted from block production in excess of the standard block reward and gas fees by including, excluding, and changing the order of transactions in a block.

**Priority Fee**

To be paid by the transaction originator to a Layer 2 sequencer to obtain a desired slot for its transaction in a new block.

Note that the exact position of a transaction in a new block may be determined by factors such as time-stamp, or minimization of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) of a block in addition to a Priority Fee.

**Sequencer**

Collects transactions, publishes them in a batch to the Layer 1 on which the Layer 2 operates, receives transaction fees from the published transactions, pays Layer 2 fees to other Layer 2 protocol participants, and, if required, participates in a consensus algorithm with other sequencers to determine transaction  ordering in a block.


**Sidechain:**

A secondary blockchain connected to the main blockchain with a two-way peg and using its own trust assumptions.

**Transaction Fee**

The fee in a Layer 2 network or protocol token to be paid by a transaction originator comprised of the sum of a Base Fee, an Execution Fee and a Priority Fee.

## 1.3 Typographical Conventions

### 1.3.1 Requirement Ids

A requirement is uniquely identified by a unique ID composed of its requirement level followed by a requirement number, as per convention **[RequirementLevelRequirementNumber]**. 
There are four requirement levels that are coded in requirement ids as per below convention: 

**[R]** - The requirement level for requirements which IDs start with the letter _R_ is to be interpreted as **MUST** as described in [RFC2119](#rfc2119). \
**[D]** - The requirement level for requirements which IDs start with the letter _D_ is to be interpreted as **SHOULD** as described in [RFC2119](#rfc2119). \
**[O]** - The requirement level for requirements which IDs start with the letter _O_ is to be interpreted as **MAY** as described in [RFC2119](#rfc2119). 

Note that requirements are uniquely numbered in ascending order within each requirement level.

Example : It should be read that [R1] is an absolute requirement of the specification whereas [D1] is a recommendation and [O1] is truly optional.

# 4 Conformance

This section describes the conformance clauses and tests required to achieve an implementation that is provably conformant with the requirements in this document.

## 4.1 Conformance Targets

This document does not yet define a standardized set of test-fixtures with test inputs for all MUST, SHOULD, and MAY requirements with conditional MUST or SHOULD requirements. 

A standardized set of test-fixtures with test inputs for all MUST, SHOULD, and MAY requirements with conditional MUST or SHOULD requirements is intended to be published with the next version of the standard.

## 4.2 Conformance Levels

This section specifies the conformance levels of this standard. The conformance levels offer implementers several levels of conformance. These can be used to establish competitive differentiation.

This document defines the conformance levels of Layer 2 Transaction Fees as follows:
* **Level 1:** All MUST requirements are fulfilled by a specific implementation as proven by a test report that proves in an easily understandable manner the implementation's conformance with each requirement based on implementation-specific test-fixtures with implementation-specific test-fixture inputs.
* **Level 2:** All MUST and SHOULD requirements are fulfilled by a specific implementation as proven by a test report that proves in an easily understandable manner the implementation's conformance with each requirement based on implementation-specific test-fixtures with implementation-specific test-fixture inputs.
* **Level 3:** All MUST, SHOULD, and MAY requirements with conditional MUST or SHOULD requirements are fulfilled by a specific implementation as proven by a test report that proves in an easily understandable manner the implementation's conformance with each requirement based on implementation-specific test-fixtures with implementation-specific test-fixture inputs.

#### **[DX]** 
A claim that a Layer 2 transaction fee implementation conforms to this specification SHOULD describe the testing procedure used to justify the claim.

#### **[RX]** 
A claim that a Layer 2 transaction fee conforms to this specification at **level 2** or higher MUST describe the testing procedure used to justify the claim.

# Appendix A - References

This appendix contains the normative and non-normative references that are used in this document. 

While any hyperlinks included in this appendix were valid at the time of publication, OASIS cannot guarantee their long-term validity.

## A.1 Normative References

The following documents are referenced in such a way that some or all of their content constitute requirements of this document.

#### **[RFC2119]**
 S. Bradner, Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels, http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt, IETF RFC 2119, March 1997.


## A.2 Non-Normative References

TBD


# Appendix B - Security Considerations

TBD

## B.1 Data Privacy

The standard does not set any requirements for compliance to jurisdiction legislation/regulations. It is the responsibility of the implementer to comply with applicable data privacy laws.

## B.2 Production Readiness 

The standard does not set any requirements for the use of specific applications/tools/libraries etc. The implementer should perform due diligence when selecting specific applications/tools/libraries.

<!--

(Note: OASIS strongly recommends that Open Projects consider issues that might affect safety, security, privacy, and/or data protection in implementations of their specification and document them for implementers and adopters. For some purposes, you may find it required, e.g. if you apply for IANA registration.

While it may not be immediately obvious how your specification might make systems vulnerable to attack, most specifications, because they involve communications between systems, message formats, or system settings, open potential channels for exploitation. For example, IETF [[RFC3552](#rfc3552)] lists “eavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, and man-in-the-middle” as well as potential denial of service attacks as threats that must be considered and, if appropriate, addressed in IETF RFCs.

In addition to considering and describing foreseeable risks, this section should include guidance on how implementers and adopters can protect against these risks.

We encourage editors and OP members concerned with this subject to read _Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security Considerations_, IETF [[RFC3552](#rfc3552)], for more information.
