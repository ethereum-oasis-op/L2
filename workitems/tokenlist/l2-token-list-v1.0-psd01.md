# 1 Introduction

The L2 WG is an open-source initiative with a scope to
- Identify and document the most relevant use cases and business requirements for Layer 2 and other Blockchain Scalability solutions for EVM compatible public blockchains
- Define a technical standard with identification and differentiation of classes of scalability solutions as required that meet both ecosystem and enterprise requirements, with a particular focus on interoperability between Layer 2 solutions for EVM compatible public blockchains
- For EVM compatible public blockchains, identify, document, and devise solution approaches for Layer 2 Blockchain scalability solution specific challenges such as MEV, block (gas) limits, TVL concentration, etc.
- Identify and document characteristics of Layer 2 Blockchain environments for EVM compatible public blockchains that will be key in addressing mainstream and enterprise adoption.

The work is an [Ethereum Community Project](https://entethalliance.org/eeacommunityprojects/), which is managed by [OASIS](https://oasis-open-projects.org/).

## 1.1 Overview

There is a significant challenge around the definition and listing of tokens on Layer 1 (L1), Layer 2 (L2), and Sidechain systems. Note that for simplicity, this document we will collectively refer to L1, L2 and Sidechain systems as chains below since the challenge described below is valid across all such systems:

* Consensus on the "canonical" token on chain B that corresponds to some token on chain A. When one wants to bridge token X from chain A to chain B, one must create some new representation of the token on chain B. It is worth noting that this problem is not limited to L2s -- every chain connected via bridges must deal with the same issue.

Related to the above challenge is the standardization around lists of bridges and their routes across different chains. This will be addressed in a separate document. 

Note that both of these issues are fundamental problems for the current multi-chain world.

Therefore, the goal of this document is to help token users to operationalize and disambiguate the usage of a token in their systems.

Also note that a standard for defining tokens is beyond the scope of this document

## 1.2 Glossary

**Blockchain:**

An open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way.

**Bridge:**

Provides a connection that allows for the transfer of digital tokens or data between two different Layer 1, Layer 2 or Sidechain systems.

**Layer 1:**

A base blockchain network, such as Bitcoin, or Ethereum, and its underlying infrastructure that validates and finalizes transactions without the need of another blockchain network.

**Layer 2:**

A secondary framework or protocol that is built on top of an existing Layer 1 system in such a way that it inherits the security properties of the Layer 1 system while allowing for a higher transaction throughput that the Layer 1 system.

**Sidechain:**

A secondary blockchain connected to the main blockchain with a two-way peg and using its own trust assumptions.

**Two-Way Peg:**

A mechanism by which tokens are transferred between a blockchain and a sidechain and back at a fixed or otherwise deterministic exchange rate.

## 1.3 Typographical Conventions

### 1.3.1 Requirement Ids

A requirement is uniquely identified by a unique ID composed of its requirement level followed by a requirement number, as per convention **[RequirementLevelRequirementNumber]**. 
There are four requirement levels that are coded in requirement ids as per below convention: 

**[R]** - The requirement level for requirements which IDs start with the letter _R_ is to be interpreted as **MUST** as described in [RFC2119](#rfc2119). \
**[D]** - The requirement level for requirements which IDs start with the letter _D_ is to be interpreted as **SHOULD** as described in [RFC2119](#rfc2119). \
**[O]** - The requirement level for requirements which IDs start with the letter _O_ is to be interpreted as **MAY** as described in [RFC2119](#rfc2119). 

Note that requirements are uniquely numbered in ascending order within each requirement level.

Example : It should be read that [R1] is an absolute requirement of the specification whereas [D1] is a recommendation and [O1] is truly optional.

# 2 Concepts and Design

For lists of canonical tokens, L2s currently maintain their own customized versions of the Uniswap token list. For example, Arbitrum maintains a [token list](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/token-list-42161.json) with various custom extensions. Optimism also maintains a [custom token list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/master/optimism.tokenlist.json), but with different extensions. It should be noted that both of these custom extensions refer to the bridge that these tokens can be carried through. However, these are not the only bridges that the tokens can be carried through, which means that bridges and token lists should be separated. Also note that currently, both Optimism and Arbitrum base "canonicity" on the token name + symbol pair.

An example of an Arbitrum token entry is given below:
```
{
logoURI: "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/13469/thumb/1inch-token.png?1608803028",
chainId: 42161,
address: "0x6314C31A7a1652cE482cffe247E9CB7c3f4BB9aF",
name: "1INCH Token",
symbol: "1INCH",
decimals: 18,
extensions: {
  bridgeInfo: {
    1: {
    tokenAddress: "0x111111111117dc0aa78b770fa6a738034120c302",
    originBridgeAddress: "0x09e9222e96e7b4ae2a407b98d48e330053351eee",
    destBridgeAddress: "0xa3A7B6F88361F48403514059F1F16C8E78d60EeC"
     }
   }
  }
}
```
This standard will build upon the current framework and augment it with concepts from the W3C DID Specification [[1]](#w3c-did) based on the JSON linked data model [[2]](#jsonld) such as resolvable unique resource identifiers (URIs) and JSON-LD schemas which enable easier schema verification using existing tools.

# 3 Token List Specification

The schema for a canonical token list utilizes draft version 7 of https://json-schema.org for consistency purposes with the [W3C CCG](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/) effort. 

#### **[R1]**
The following data elements MUST be present in a canonical token list:
- type
- tokenListId
- name
- createdAt
- updatedAt
- versions
- tokens

Note, that the detailed definition of the data elements in [[R1]](#r1) along with descriptions and examples are given in the schema itself below.

[[R1]](#r1) testability: See suggested test fixtures for the data schema below. 

#### **[R2]**
The tokens data element is a composite which MUST minimally contain the following data elements:
- chainId
- chainURI
- tokenId
- tokenType
- address
- name
- symbol
- decimals
- createdAt
- updatedAt

Note, that the detailed definition of the data elements in [[R2]](#r2) along with descriptions and examples are given in the schema itself below.

[[R2]](#r2) testability: See suggested test fixtures for this documents' data schema below.

#### **[D1]**
All other data elements of the schema SHOULD be included in a representation of a canonical token list.

[[D1]](#d1) testability: See suggested test fixtures for this documents' data schema below.

#### **[CR1]>[D1]**
If the extension data elements is used, the following data elements MUST be present in the schema representation:
- rootChainId
- rootChainURI
- rootAddress

Note, that the detailed definition of the data elements in [[D1]](#d1) and [[CR1]>[D1]](#cr1d1) along with descriptions and examples are given in the schema itself below.

[[CR1]>[D1]](#cr1d1) testability: See suggested test fixtures for this documents' data schema below.

#### **[R3]**
All properties in the schema identified in the description to be a Universal Resource Identifier (URI) MUST follow in their semantics [RFC 3986](#rfc3986).

[[R3]](#r3) testability: All requirements for [RFC 3986](#rfc3986) are testable.

#### **[R4]**
The chainId property utilized MUST allow for the requirements of the EIP-155 standard to be met.

Namely, transaction replay protection on the network that is identified by the chainId property value. Note, that for replay protection to be guaranteed, the chainId should be unique. Ensuring a unique chainId is beyond the scope of this document.

[[R4]](#r4) testability: EIP-155 requires that a transaction hash is derived from the keccak256 hash of the following nine RLP encoded elements `(nonce, gasprice, startgas, to, value, data, chainid, 0, 0)` which can be tested easily with existing cryptographic libraries. EIP-155 further requires that the `v` value of the secp256k1 signature must be set to `{0,1} + CHAIN_ID * 2 + 35` where `{0,1}` is the parity of the `y` value of the curve point for which the signature `r`-value is the `x`-value in the secp256k1 signing process. This requirement is testable with available open-source secp256k1 digital signature suites. Therefore, [[R4]](#r4) is testable. 

#### **[D2]**
The `chainId` property SHOULD follow [EIP-3220](#eip3220) draft standard.

[[D2]](#d2) testability: The [EIP-3220](#eip3220) draft standard can be tested because the crosschain id is specified as a concatenation of well-defined strings, and using open source tooling can be used to parse and split a crosschain id, the obtained string segments can be compared against expected string lengths, and context dependent, the values for the strings specified in the standard. Consequently, [[D2]](#d2) is testable.

#### **[O1]**
The `humanReadableTokenSymbol` property MAY be used.

[[O1]](#o1) testability: A data property is always implementable in a schema.

#### **[CR2]>[O1]**
The `humanReadableTokenSymbol` property MUST be constructed as the hyphenated concatenation of first the `tokenSymbol` and then the `chainId`.

An example would be:
```
"tokenSymbol" = ETH;
"chainId" = 1;
"humanReadableTokenSymbol" = ETH-1;
```

[[CR2]>[O1]](#cr2o1) testability: `humanReadableTokenSymbol` can be parsed and split based on existing open source packages and the result compared to the `tokenSymbol` and `chainId` used in the data schema.


The schema for a canonical token list is given below as follows and can be utilized as a JSON-LD schema if a JSON-LD context file is utilized (see [[1]](#w3c-did) for a concrete example in the context of a standard):

Data Schema Testability: As the above data schema follows a JSON/JSON-LD schema format, and since such formats are known to be testable for schema conformance (see for example the [W3C CCG Traceability Work Item](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop)), the above data schema is testable.

# 4 Conformance

This section describes the conformance clauses and tests required to achieve an implementation that is provably conformant with the requirements in this document.

## 4.1 Conformance Targets

This document does not yet define a standardized set of test-fixtures with test inputs for all MUST, SHOULD, and MAY requirements with conditional MUST or SHOULD requirements. 

A standardized set of test-fixtures with test inputs for all MUST, SHOULD, and MAY requirements with conditional MUST or SHOULD requirements is intended to be published with the next version of the standard.

## 4.2 Conformance Levels

This section specifies the conformance levels of this standard. The conformance levels offer implementers several levels of conformance. These can be used to establish competitive differentiation.

This document defines the conformance levels of a canonical token list as follows:
* **Level 1:** All MUST requirements are fulfilled by a specific implementation as proven by a test report that proves in an easily understandable manner the implementation's conformance with each requirement based on implementation-specific test-fixtures with implementation-specific test-fixture inputs.
* **Level 2:** All MUST and SHOULD requirements are fulfilled by a specific implementation as proven by a test report that proves in an easily understandable manner the implementation's conformance with each requirement based on implementation-specific test-fixtures with implementation-specific test-fixture inputs.
* **Level 3:** All MUST, SHOULD, and MAY requirements with conditional MUST or SHOULD requirements are fulfilled by a specific implementation as proven by a test report that proves in an easily understandable manner the implementation's conformance with each requirement based on implementation-specific test-fixtures with implementation-specific test-fixture inputs.

#### **[D3]** 
A claim that a canonical token list implementation conforms to this specification SHOULD describe a testing procedure carried out for each requirement to which conformance is claimed, that justifies the claim with respect to that requirement.

[[D3]](#d3) testability: Since each of the non-conformance-target requirements in this documents is testable, so must be the totality of the requirements in this document. Therefore, conformance tests for all requirements can exist, and can be described as required in [[D3]](#d3).

#### **[R5]** 
A claim that a canonical token list implementation conforms to this specification at **Level 2** or higher MUST describe the testing procedure carried out for each requirement at **Level 2** or higher, that justifies the claim to that requirement.

[[R5]](#r5) testability: Since each of the non-conformance-target requirements in this documents is testable, so must be the totality of the requirements in this document. Therefore, conformance tests for all requirements can exist, be described, be built and implemented and results can be recorded as required in [[R5]](#r5).

# Appendix B - Security Considerations

There are no additional security requirements apart from the warnings that URIs utilized in implementations of this standard might be direct to malicious resources such as websites, and that implementers should ensure that data utilized for a canonical token list is secure and correct. Since this standard is focused on a data schema and its data properties there are no additional security considerations from for example homoglyph attacks (see [CVE-2021-42574](#CVE-2021-42574)).

## B.1 Data Privacy

The standard does not set any requirements for compliance to jurisdiction legislation/regulations. It is the responsibility of the implementer to comply with applicable data privacy laws.

## B.2 Production Readiness 

The standard does not set any requirements for the use of specific applications/tools/libraries etc. The implementer should perform due diligence when selecting specific applications/tools/libraries.

## B.3 Internationalization and Localization

The standard encourages implementers to follow the [W3C "Strings on the Web: Language and Direction Metadata" best practices guide](#w3c-string-meta) for identifying language and base direction for strings used on the Web wherever appropriate. 

<!--

(Note: OASIS strongly recommends that Open Projects consider issues that might affect safety, security, privacy, and/or data protection in implementations of their specification and document them for implementers and adopters. For some purposes, you may find it required, e.g. if you apply for IANA registration.

While it may not be immediately obvious how your specification might make systems vulnerable to attack, most specifications, because they involve communications between systems, message formats, or system settings, open potential channels for exploitation. For example, IETF [[RFC3552](#rfc3552)] lists âeavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, and man-in-the-middleâ as well as potential denial of service attacks as threats that must be considered and, if appropriate, addressed in IETF RFCs.

In addition to considering and describing foreseeable risks, this section should include guidance on how implementers and adopters can protect against these risks.

We encourage editors and OP members concerned with this subject to read _Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security Considerations_, IETF [[RFC3552](#rfc3552)], for more information.

As stated in the OASIS IPR Policy, the following three paragraphs in brackets apply to OASIS Standards Final Deliverable documents (Project Specifications, OASIS Standards, or Approved Errata).

\[OASIS requests that any OASIS Party or any other party that believes it has patent claims that would necessarily be infringed by implementations of this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable, to notify OASIS TC Administrator and provide an indication of its willingness to grant patent licenses to such patent claims in a manner consistent with the IPR Mode of the OASIS Open Project that produced this deliverable.\]

\[OASIS invites any party to contact the OASIS TC Administrator if it is aware of a claim of ownership of any patent claims that would necessarily be infringed by implementations of this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable by a patent holder that is not willing to provide a license to such patent claims in a manner consistent with the IPR Mode of the OASIS Open Project that produced this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable. OASIS may include such claims on its website but disclaims any obligation to do so.\]

\[OASIS takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable or the extent to which any license under such rights might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it has made any effort to identify any such rights. Information on OASIS' procedures with respect to rights in any document or deliverable produced by an OASIS Open Project can be found on the OASIS website. Copies of claims of rights made available for publication and any assurances of licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made to obtain a general license or permission for the use of such proprietary rights by implementers or users of this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable, can be obtained from the OASIS TC Administrator. OASIS makes no representation that any information or list of intellectual property rights will at any time be complete, or that any claims in such list are, in fact, Essential Claims.\]
