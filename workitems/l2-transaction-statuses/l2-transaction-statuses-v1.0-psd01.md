# 1 Introduction
###### L2TSSPECINTRO

The L2 WG is an open-source initiative with a scope to
- Identify and document the most relevant use cases and business requirements for Layer 2 and other Blockchain Scalability solutions for EVM compatible public blockchains
- Define a technical standard with identification and differentiation of classes of scalability solutions as required that meet both ecosystem and enterprise requirements, with a particular focus on interoperability between Layer 2 solutions for EVM compatible public blockchains
- For EVM compatible public blockchains, identify, document, and devise solution approaches for Layer 2 Blockchain scalability solution specific challenges such as MEV, block (gas) limits, TVL concentration, etc.
- Identify and document characteristics of Layer 2 Blockchain environments for EVM compatible public blockchains that will be key in addressing mainstream and enterprise adoption.

The work is an Ethereum Community Project which is managed by [OASIS](https://oasis-open-projects.org/).

## 1.1 Overview
###### L2TSSPECOVERV

Several recent discussions in the Ethereum Ecosystem, in particular in the RollCall Group managing [RIPs](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs), showed that a lack of standards around the processing status of an L2 transaction is confusing not only for users and developers working on block explorers, wallets, smart contracts, or chain analytics but also for L2 client teams themselves trying to understand what different statuses of different L2 clients mean, and what trust assumptions have been made for each status. Besides confusion, there are real security risks, especially for L2 bridges based on the processing status of an L2 transaction (finalized on an L2 but not on an L1 vs finalized on an L2 and on an L1).

This topic of discussion also arose in the [L2 Standards WG](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/L2) when discussing the [L2 Transaction Fee API specification](**TODO: add Github link once PR is merged**).

This standard is addressing confusion around L2 Transaction Statuses, and defines a set of universal L2 Transaction Statuses, with status codes, and their trust assumptions, for the lifecycle of an L2 Transaction.

Note, that this standard does not prevent additional, non-duplicative L2 transaction statuses to be defined based on the details of an L2 client. For example, an Optimistic L2 has additional intermediate transaction statuses having to do with the challenge period compared to Zero-Knowledge based L2s.


## 1.2 Glossary
###### L2TSSPECGLOS

**Developer:**

An individual writing computer code for software applications that operate on a Layer 1, Layer 2 or Sidechain.

**Layer 1:**

A base network, such as Bitcoin, or Ethereum, and its underlying infrastructure that validates and finalizes transactions without the need of another network.

**Layer 2:**

A secondary framework or protocol that is built on top of an existing Layer 1 system in such a way that it inherits the security properties of the Layer 1 system while allowing for a higher transaction throughput than the Layer 1 system.

**Transaction:**

A digitally signed message sent from a Layer 2 account that contains instructions and data that result in a Layer 2 state transition. 

**Transaction Status:**

The current stage of a Layer 2 transaction in its lifecycle from initial submission on the L2 to finalization on the L1.

Note that the lifecycle stages can vary between different L2 types.


## 1.3 Typographical Conventions
###### L2TSSPECTYPO

### 1.3.1 Requirement Ids
###### L2TSSPECREQIDS

A requirement is uniquely identified by a unique ID composed of its requirement level followed by a requirement number, as per convention **[RequirementLevelRequirementNumber]**. 
There are four requirement levels that are coded in requirement ids as per below convention: 

**[R]** - The requirement level for requirements which IDs start with the letter _R_ is to be interpreted as **MUST** as described in [RFC2119](#rfc2119). \
**[D]** - The requirement level for requirements which IDs start with the letter _D_ is to be interpreted as **SHOULD** as described in [RFC2119](#rfc2119). \
**[O]** - The requirement level for requirements which IDs start with the letter _O_ is to be interpreted as **MAY** as described in [RFC2119](#rfc2119). 

Note that requirements are uniquely numbered in ascending order within each requirement level.

Example : It should be read that [R1] is an absolute requirement of the specification whereas [D1] is a recommendation and [O1] is truly optional.

# 2 Concepts and Design
###### L2TSSPECCONCEPT

The L2 Transaction Statuses specification is define an L2 Transaction Status as having:

- A common name denoted by an alpha numeric string
- A status code denoted by an alpha numeric string similar to HTTP status codes
- A Trust Assumption that specifies the security assumptions made and subsequent security guarantees of an L2 Transaction Status

# 3 Layer 2 Transaction Statuses Specification
###### L2TSSPECSEC

The specification of the L2 Transaction Status Specification has two sections:

- Layer 2 Transaction Statuses Definitions
- Layer 2 Transaction Statuses Requirements

## 3.1 Layer 2 Transaction Statuses Definitions
###### L2TFSPECTFDATASCHEMA

The minimal set of transaction statuses is defined as follows:

1. **L2 Pending**
    - **Definition**: An L2 transaction submitted to an L2, and waiting to be processed by a sequencer
    - **Trust Assumption**: No inclusion guarantee on the L2
    - **Transaction Status Code**: `L2TS00100`
2. **L2 Replaced**
    - **Definition**: An L2 transaction that was "Pending" was replaced by another L2 transaction.
    - **Trust Assumption**: Same as L2 Pending
    - **Transaction Status Code**: `L2TS00200`
3. **L2 Dropped**
    - **Definition**: An L2 transaction that was removed from the L2 processing queue.
    - **Trust Assumption**: NA
    - **Transaction Status Code**: `L2TS00300`
4. **L2 Confirmed**
    - **Definition**: An L2 transaction processed by a sequencer and assigned an order in a proposed L2 block by the sequencer by applying an L2 client-specific L2 transaction ordering protocol
    - **Trust Assumption**: The L2 transaction order guarantee is based on the security guarantee of the ordering protocol. Inclusion in finalized L2 and L1 blocks is not guaranteed.
    - **Transaction Status Code**: `L2TS00400`
5. **L2 Included, L1 Pending**
    - **Definition**: An L2 transaction included in an L2 block but not yet submitted to the L1.
    - **Trust Assumption**: The L2 inclusion guarantee is dependent on the submission guarantee of the L2 block to the L1 and the L1 finalization.
    - **Transaction Status Code**: `L2TS00500`
6. **L2 Included, L1 Included**
    - **Definition**: An L2 transaction included in an L2 block included in an L1 block that is not yet L1 finalized.
    - **Trust Assumption**: The L2 inclusion guarantee is dependent on the L1 block finalization containing the L2 block.
    - **Transaction Status Code**: `L2TS00600`
7. **L2 Finalized, L1 Finalized** 
    - **Definition**: An L2 transaction included in a L2 block that has been included in a transaction in a finalized L1 block. 
    - **Trust Assumption**: The L2 transaction finalization guarantee is equivalent to an L1 transaction finalization guarantee in a finalized L1 block.
    - **Transaction Status Code**: `L2TS00700`


## 3.2 Layer 2 Transaction Fee Transparency Requirements
###### L2TSSPECTFAPIREQS

#### **[R1]** 

The Transaction Status Code MUST be an alphanumeric string of no more than 32 characters with the four leading characters being `L2TS`.

[[R1]](#r1) Testability: 

**Test Preconditions:**
A valid L2 transaction has been processed by an L2 system and the corresponding Transaction Status Code is available.

**Test Steps:**

1. Retrieve the Transaction Status Code from the L2 transaction API response.
2. Verify the length of the Transaction Status Code:
    - Ensure the code contains no more than 32 characters.
3. Check the leading characters of the Transaction Status Code:
    - Confirm that the first four characters are L2TS.
4. Validate the remaining characters of the Transaction Status Code:
    - Ensure the remaining characters (if any) are alphanumeric (letters and digits only).

**Passing Criteria:**

1. The Transaction Status Code is retrieved successfully.
2. The length of the Transaction Status Code is 32 characters or less.
3. The first four characters of the Transaction Status Code are L2TS.
4. All characters following L2TS (if any) are strictly alphanumeric.


# 4 Conformance

###### L2TSSPECCONF

This section describes the conformance clauses and tests required to achieve an implementation that is provably conformant with the requirements in this document.

## 4.1 Conformance Targets

###### L2TSSPECCONFT

This document does not yet define a standardized set of test-fixtures with test inputs for all MUST, SHOULD, and MAY requirements with conditional MUST or SHOULD requirements. 

A standardized set of test-fixtures with test inputs for all MUST, SHOULD, and MAY requirements with conditional MUST or SHOULD requirements is intended to be published with the next version of the standard.

## 4.2 Conformance Levels
###### L2TSSPECCONFL

This section specifies the conformance levels of this standard. The conformance levels offer implementers several levels of conformance. These can be used to establish competitive differentiation.

This document defines the conformance levels of L2 Transaction Fee API as follows:
* **Level 1:** All MUST requirements are fulfilled by a specific implementation as proven by a test report that proves in an easily understandable manner the implementation's conformance with each requirement based on implementation-specific test-fixtures with implementation-specific test-fixture inputs.
* **Level 2:** All MUST and SHOULD requirements are fulfilled by a specific implementation as proven by a test report that proves in an easily understandable manner the implementation's conformance with each requirement based on implementation-specific test-fixtures with implementation-specific test-fixture inputs.
* **Level 3:** All MUST, SHOULD, and MAY requirements with conditional MUST or SHOULD requirements are fulfilled by a specific implementation as proven by a test report that proves in an easily understandable manner the implementation's conformance with each requirement based on implementation-specific test-fixtures with implementation-specific test-fixture inputs.

#### **[D1]** 
A claim that an L2 Transaction Fee API conforms to this specification SHOULD describe a testing procedure carried out for each requirement to which conformance is claimed, that justifies the claim with respect to that requirement.

[[D1]](#d1) Testability: Since each of the conformance target requirements in this documents is testable, so must be the totality of the requirements in this document. Therefore, conformance tests for all requirements can exist, and can be described as required in [[D1]](#d1).

#### **[R2]** 
A claim that an L2 Transaction Fee API conforms to this specification at **Level 2** or higher MUST describe the testing procedure carried out for each requirement at **Level 2** or higher, that justifies the claim to that requirement.

[[R2]](#r2) Testability: Since each of the non-conformance-target requirements in this documents is testable, so must be the totality of the requirements in this document. Therefore, conformance tests for all requirements can exist, be described, be built and implemented and results can be recorded as required in [[R6]](#r6).

## B.3 Internationalization and Localization Reference
###### L2TSSPECAPBINT

The standard encourages implementers to follow the [W3C "Strings on the Web: Language and Direction Metadata" best practices guide](#w3c-string-meta) for identifying language and base direction for strings used on the Web wherever appropriate. 

<!--

(Note: OASIS strongly recommends that Open Projects consider issues that might affect safety, security, privacy, and/or data protection in implementations of their specification and document them for implementers and adopters. For some purposes, you may find it required, e.g. if you apply for IANA registration.

While it may not be immediately obvious how your specification might make systems vulnerable to attack, most specifications, because they involve communications between systems, message formats, or system settings, open potential channels for exploitation. For example, IETF [[RFC3552](#rfc3552)] lists âeavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, and man-in-the-middleâ as well as potential denial of service attacks as threats that must be considered and, if appropriate, addressed in IETF RFCs.

In addition to considering and describing foreseeable risks, this section should include guidance on how implementers and adopters can protect against these risks.

We encourage editors and OP members concerned with this subject to read _Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security Considerations_, IETF [[RFC3552](#rfc3552)], for more information.
