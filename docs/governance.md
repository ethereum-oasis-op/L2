## The Working Group
The Working Group (WG) shall be governed by its vote-eligible members, and all meetings shall be public, and publicly announced. A vote-eligible member is an entity whose representatives have collectively worked on at least 3 GitHub Issues in the preceding quarter, made or reviewed at least 3 GitHub Pull Requests in the previous quarter, and signed the WG Charter and its Governance. To get the group started, any participant is a vote-eligible member until 2022-04-01. 
 
The initial WG chair and vice-chair will be appointed by the PGB for a term expiring January 31st of 2023 based on a WG recommendation. Subsequently, the WG will recommend to the PGB a Chair and a Vice-Chair for a term of one year via an election during the month of January utilizing an online ranked-choice voting system and administered by the OASIS EEA Community Project’s Administrator.
 
A quorum of two-thirds of the vote-eligible WG members is required to conduct any vote during any given meeting. Disputes are presented to the Project Governance Board (PGB) of the EEA Community Projects for arbitration. A minimum of two vote-eligible members may raise the Dispute to the PGB.
 
No legal entity (or set of entities controlled by a single party) shall hold more than one vote-eligible seat on the WG during any given period.
 
A WG member is eligible to lose their vote-eligible status upon their representatives missing three consecutive WG meetings. Removal is completed by a simple majority vote of the remaining vote-eligible WG members that are not being considered for removal. This decision can be raised as a dispute to the PGB.
 
The Chair and Vice-Chair are responsible for conducting the WG meetings, preparing an agenda for each WG meeting in advance of the meeting to be shared electronically no later than two working days before the meeting, and publishing meeting minutes after a WG meeting within three business days. Agenda items can be raised to the Chair or Vice-Chair by any vote-eligible member before or during a WG meeting. 

## Decision-Making Process
The group will seek to work by “lazy consensus” as described in the EEA Community Project Governance Documents. Where any vote-eligible member or any two attendees of a meeting who represent different organizations, request, this formal decision process will be applied instead. Any attendee at a meeting may use this process.

* At a WG meeting, any contributor (“the Proposer”) may make a proposal and will present their proposal to those present at the meeting. The time allotted to this presentation will be determined by the Chair.
* After the proposal is presented, there will be a period for feedback from the group, The time allotted to feedback will be determined by the Chair but is minimally the time between two WG meetings.
    * The Proposer is encouraged to accept as much of the feedback as is possible without interfering with the intent of their proposal.
    * The feedback may be accepted at the moment; in this case, the Proposer will alter their proposal in real-time and publish these alterations following the meeting.
* After the feedback, the Proposer may ask the group:
    * To move forward with the proposal (including alterations, if applicable);
    * For additional time to alter and resubmit the proposal at a later date; or
    * To disregard the proposal, at which point the proposal will no longer be considered for passage.
* If the Proposer asks the group to move forward with the proposal, the Chair will ask the group if there is a strong disagreement.
    * If there is no strong disagreement, the proposal will move forward. 
        * Strong Disagreement is defined as at least a third of vote-eligible members objecting to a proposal
    * If there is a strong disagreement, the Proposer will be asked whether they are willing to form a task force with the members that have raised the strong disagreement to create a new proposal incorporating the objections.
        * If yes, it will be up to the Working Group to alter and resubmit the proposal.
        * If not, the participants of the WG meeting where the strong disagreement is raised and initially discussed will determine an adequate time frame of no less than the time between two meetings when a counter-proposal has to be submitted. 
* If the working group can find a compromise proposal, the compromise proposal is submitted as a new proposal. If the working group cannot reach a rough consensus (i.e. without “strong disagreement” as defined in this document),  a compromise proposal, the relevant proposals are submitted as a Dispute to the PGB.
