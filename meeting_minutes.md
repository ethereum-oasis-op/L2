Anais said that the EEA Crosschain Interop WG has already been working on a solution to this problem, and the work in development is expected to be made public in the next week or two. Some information and specs are also public already, including a proposed EIP to identify chains The group is anticipating reaching Interop Testing in Q2.  Further discussion is needed.  We will probably go forward with the post anyway, to raise awareness of the problem and solution(s), but after discussion with the Crosschain Interop WG.
* Noting that many participants here are EEA members so can participate directly in the EEA work.

## Meeting: Wed, 17th Nov, 2021, 7 am PT / 10 am ET / 16:00 BST

Scribe: Dan Shaw

Attending: Andreas, Tas Dienes, Dan Shaw, Chet Ensign,
Alim Karim,
Karthik Solimpuram,
Samrat Kishor,
Sandeep Nailwal, Polygon (new member),
Samrat Kishor,
Sebastian Stammler,
Steven Goldfeder

Andreas introduces Chet Ensign of OASIS.

Chet is the point of contact with the OASIS staff who is responsible for facilitating participants.

Explains the rules

Find a way to complete the work

OASIS has been involved in Open Source and OPEN Standards since 1993. Ensure IPR. Ensure correct voting procedures.

OASIS is particularly beneficial when the work you’re working on is desired to be an international standard.

Chet notes changes to how folks are building things. Open Source now exceeds Open Standards as a starting point. Provides open source work a path to standards. Most projects want to start as an Open Project. EEA retains the brand, governed by the OASIS process.

EEA Open Projects is the umbrella group for Baseline Protocol, JSON

The project chair reports regularly to the EEA Community Projects project governing board (PGB).

Benefits: Projects get both the EEA stamp of approval and the OASIS stamp of approval. You can determine what goes forward as an OASIS standard. OASIS can steward the standardization process through a number of international standards bodies.

Process for PGB approval: likely within 2 weeks.

Thank you, Chet.

7:25: Sandeep Nailwal representing Polygon introduces himself and provided an overview of Polygon’s offerings, involvement in the ecosystem, and interest in Layer 2.

7:30: Back to the governance review

A suggestion has been made to consider changing the license from CC0 1.0 Universal to Apache 2.0. Apache 2.0 is the default for EEA Community Projects. Chet Ensign noted that CC0 is needed by companies like EY and Accenture (organizations with audit departments).

Sebastian expressed concern that CC0 might deter some contributors from engaging with the project since it is an unknown license.

Chet asks if there were any explicit objects to Apache 2.0 as the license.

Kartheek will check with EY legal to make sure if the project only produces specification text that Apache 2.0 will be OK.

Sebastian expresses concern that solidity interface files might not be adopted if they are using the CC0 license.

No objections were made to the improved definition of the “substantial” participation requirement for working group membership.

Decision-Making Process was reviewed and ratified without objection.

The ratification Process was reviewed and ratified without objection.

Andreas called for final objections. None were made. The governance doc will be submitted with a known open issue for final license selection between CC0 and Apache 2.0, both of which are approved licenses.

From Chat:

Alim: Andreas — re. License — on my side checking with the VMW legal team as well for our participation. Expect to have an answer by next week.

Action Items:
* Kartheek: To check with EY legal to make sure if the project only produces specification text that Apache 2.0 will be OK 
* Alim: To check with the VMW legal team as well for our participation. Expect to have an answer by next week.
* Tas (as PGB member): Submit Charter and Governance doc for approval to EEA - OASIS PGB during next PGB meeting; Status: Submitted awaiting a decision on 1st of December meeting.

Minutes:

Andreas: described meeting rules which were emailed earlier
- Have a transcriber on a rotating basis to take notes, post them in the channel, if the meeting is recorded, notes are automatically recorded
- Scribe required
- Meeting rules described
- Governance emailed
- Rules: everyone to be kind, for the betterment

Cody burns: introduction . . ., from Accenture

Andreas: question to the group, is everyone OK with meeting rules

Andreas: charter of the group. Two ways, quick review, share screen, Q&A session, specific questions, went through the charter. Available at google docs (insert link)

Tas: I like goals, but standards should be mentioned more explicitly.

Samrat: should we include ESG?

Andreas:  probably we can

Bruno: good idea,

Samrat: Blockchains consume a lot of  energy and generate carbon .. Standardize to switch to greener protocols

Sam: I will comment on ESG after but  scalability is the main focus and we should focus on privacy and performance as well … ESG is not our core focus at this point

Bruno: ESG could be the indirect result . . .  I believe that we should align early to  ESG

Samrat: we can add it later if clearer goal in future

Andreas: Leave ESG as an open topic

Tas: Added a suggestion, facilitating interoperability  among different L2s and L1s, and developing appropriate standards

Andreas: ESG should be incorporated now? Poll taken? Some +1s

Cody: intro: Accenture blockchain, metaverse, identity, happy to work on L2

Andreas: read Scope from the google docs document

Samrat: where is this initiative going, would L2 will evolve into Layer 3.

Andreas: go with the flow... We’ll see

Bruno: good question, the difference between L2 and L3, L2 on top of sidechain, it can be named as layer 3

Andreas: recited scope in the charter

John Wolpert: if this group works under EEA, then participants must be members of EEA, otherwise if OASIS then it can be open,  need some money from sponsors, if OASIS route: add some cash, as it’s a community project, if under EEA: grants can be given . .  Emphasized coordination issues when it comes to money and grants.

Andreas: agree with John, however, once something significant is produced. Then donation bucket can be passed around at that time

John: it's serious business .   . .

Andreas: True

John: I’ll rest here

Andreas: Segway, to WG chains

Andreas: proposal for WG chains

Andreas: park that item for next week,  discuss it at next week’s meeting, thank you for a great meeting
